It includes: Unlimited Unicorn Tear Eye Drops: For sparkling vision, the ability to spot a typo from a mile away, and occasionally seeing rainbows where there are none. Dragon Scale Dental Implants: Indestructible, pearly white, they glow faintly in moonlight, and can be used to open particularly stubborn pickle jars. Griffin Feather Pillows & Comforters: For the most regenerative sleep imaginable. On-site Alchemist & Potion Master: For all your minor transmutation needs, bespoke wellness potions, and emergency glitter infusions. (Warning: Do not request the Philosopher's Stone. HR gets very cross, and the paperwork is a nightmare.)"
