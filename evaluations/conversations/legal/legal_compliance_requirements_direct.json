      "expected_output": "Compliance operates at two levels. As a core principle, contract review must verify adherence to FantaCo's internal policies, legal requirements, industry standards, and regulatory obligations. During contract review, analysts specifically check Legal Compliance by identifying any clauses that may violate laws, regulations, or FantaCo's legal guidelines — including data privacy, intellectual property, and anti-bribery — and flag items requiring Legal Department input.",

          "3. Key Principles of Contract Review\n\nContract review at FantaCo Enterprise is guided by the following principles:\n● Risk Mitigation: Proactively identify and address potential legal, financial, operational, and compliance risks.\n● Accuracy & Completeness: Ensure all contractual terms are accurate, complete, unambiguous, and reflect the agreed-upon business terms.\n● Compliance: Verify adherence to FantaCo's internal policies, legal requirements, industry standards, and regulatory obligations.\n● Efficiency: Conduct reviews in a timely manner without compromising thoroughness, to facilitate business operations.\n● Collaboration: Work effectively with internal departments (e.g., Legal, Finance, Procurement, Sales) to understand context and ensure alignment.\n● Confidentiality: Protect sensitive and proprietary information contained within contracts and during the review process.",
          "Key Areas of Review:\n■ Legal Compliance: Identify any clauses that may violate laws, regulations, or FantaCo's legal guidelines (e.g., data privacy, intellectual property, anti-bribery). Flag items requiring Legal Department input.\n■ Financial Terms: Verify pricing, payment terms, currency, tax implications, and revenue recognition against financial policies. Flag items for Finance Department review.\n■ Risk Assessment: Identify and assess liabilities, indemnities, warranties, limitations of liability, and termination clauses. Propose modifications to mitigate identified risks.\n■ Operational Feasibility: Ensure terms are operationally executable by relevant FantaCo departments (e.g., delivery schedules, service levels, technical specifications).\n■ Internal Consistency: Check for contradictions or ambiguities within the contract itself.\n■ Term & Termination: Verify clear start/end dates, renewal options, and termination rights/obligations."
