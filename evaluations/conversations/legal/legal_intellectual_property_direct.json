Flag items requiring Legal Department input.\n■ Financial Terms: Verify pricing, payment terms, currency, tax implications, and revenue recognition against financial policies. Flag items for Finance Department review.\n■ Risk Assessment: Identify and assess liabilities, indemnities, warranties, limitations of liability, and termination clauses. Propose modifications to mitigate identified risks.\n■ Operational Feasibility: Ensure terms are operationally executable by relevant FantaCo departments (e.g., delivery schedules, service levels, technical specifications).\n■ Internal Consistency: Check for contradictions or ambiguities within the contract itself.\n■ Term & Termination: Verify clear start/end dates, renewal options, and termination rights/obligations."
