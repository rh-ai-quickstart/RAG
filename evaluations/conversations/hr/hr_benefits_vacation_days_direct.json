Unused Adventure Units can be traded for shares in the company's moon-cheese mining operation or a slightly used hovercraft.",

Want to spend a month learning to throat-sing with Tuvan monks while simultaneously training for a marathon on the Great Wall of China? Go for it. Fancy a weekend jaunt to Atlantis (scuba gear, merman translators, and complimentary waterproof notebooks provided)? Be our guest! Unused Adventure Units can be traded for shares in the company's highly lucrative (and entirely fictional, wink wink) moon-cheese mining operation or a slightly used hovercraft."
